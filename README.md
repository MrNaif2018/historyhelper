# History helper

This is a side-project I did for history lessons, to help students learn history more efficently by aggregating needed information into
kanban-style cards for ease of learning.

Used technologies: Python (FastAPI) for backend, Nuxt.js and Vuetify.js for admin panel and main UI.

Note: some texts in this app are in Russian, as introducing i18n for a simple project with limited community is not worth it.
